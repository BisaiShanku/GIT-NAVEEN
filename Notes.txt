What is GIT? GIT vs GITHUB
--------------------------------------------------



GIT Basics - My First Repo In GIT || PUSH & PULL In GIT
----------------------------------------------------
I have added the Notes file and the Thread Synchronization issue file here
Now we would push the code with the following command

git remote add origin https://github.com/BisaiShanku/GIT-NAVEEN.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
